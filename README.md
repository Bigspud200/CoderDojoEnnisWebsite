# CoderDojo Ennis Public Website

This is the publicly visible information about our Dojo.

The source code is built on the Nuxt 4 framework.  But the actual content is not taking advantage of this.  It is simply static html, styles, and iamges in the /src/public folder.

Feel free to make content changes or more major changes to actual Vue/Nuxt components.  Pull Requests welcome.
