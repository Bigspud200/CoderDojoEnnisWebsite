                        <h3>Scratch</h3>
                        <img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;max-width:25%;height:auto" alt="Scratch Logo" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Scratch_Logo.svg/200px-Scratch_Logo.svg.png"><br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Scratch</strong> is an early computer language learning environment enabling young beginners to get results without having to learn syntactically correct writing first. Created by the MIT Media Lab, it is intended to motivate for further learning through playfully experimenting and creating projects, such as interactive animations etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>The name Scratch derived from the turntablism’s technique of scratching and stresses the similarity of the process of programming to the process of mixing/scratching instead of its similarity to the processes of writing (i.e. scripting).</p>
                        <p>Scratch is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The source code is made available under a license that allows modifications for non-commercial uses.</p>
                        <p>You can download SCRATCH for free from the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Official Website</a>or try the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/">Version 2.0</a> which adds loads of new features.  There you can also setup an online account to share your projects with the world.  When you upload your projects from Scratch, others will be able to play your games from the Scratch website.</p>
                        <p>There is a good <a href="https://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/getting-started-guide"> introduction document that you can download and read</a>.  And lots of introductory videos on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc6IgQIhxbU">like this one</a>.</p>

                        <h3>MINI PROJECTS</h3>
                        <p>There’s a PDF you can download with some very quick (one page each) mini-projects.  It’s a great way to have some quick success and get exposed to the types of things you can do in scratch.  You can download the file here: <a href="https://info.scratch.mit.edu/Support/Scratch_Cards">http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Support/Scratch_Cards</a></p>
                        <p>Just doing a search will lead you to other project sheets such as this schools: <a href="https://nebomusic.net/scratch.html">Scratch Programming Projects</a>.</p>
                        <h3><strong>SPACE INVADERS</strong></h3>
                        <p>We talked about how to use the keyboard to move a space ship left and right on the screen, and how to fire a missile.  We created aliens who attacked from above.  And at the end of the session everyone had some sort of Space Invaders type game.</p>

                        <p>Quinn Painter continued on with his project.  He was trying to get as close to the original as possible.  His project is shared at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/quinnpainter/2457087">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/quinnpainter/2457087</a></p>
                        <h3>Gravity and Platforms</h3>
                        <p>As a first step torwards building a Super Mario type game, we talked about how gravity can be simulated with 2 variables.  One for the gravity strength (constant), and one for the vertical speed of the player.  We check if the player is touching the ground.  If he is, then we set his vertical speed to 0 and don’t change his position, otherwise we increase his vertical speed by the gravity strength and then updade his position by his speed.  Jumping was performed by just giving him a large upward vertical speed which would be taken away by gravity.</p>

                            <p><i>This is a simple project demonstrating how to use the ‘broadcast message’ feature. You use the mouse to move the first sprite towards the other sprite on the screen. When they touch, another sprite appears. You move this sprite to touch the last sprite that appeared and then another one appears – and so on.</i></p>
                            <p><i>When two sprites touch (‘meet’) a message is broadcast that the next sprite receives. Receiving this message is what tells that latter sprite to reveal itself.</i></p>

                        <div><i>This is the maze we demonstrated in the beginner class.  It uses multiple sprites to act as the little red dots that get ‘eaten’ by the ball.  This allows us to delete the sprite as soon as it’s touched so that the score only goes up by increments of 1. </i></div>
                        <div></div>
                        <div><i>When the ball gets to the end it uses the Broadcast feature to says it’s completed. Before displaying a finish screen, the score will be checked to see if all the red dots were eaten. Depending on the final score, one of two final screen sprites will be displayed.</i></div>
