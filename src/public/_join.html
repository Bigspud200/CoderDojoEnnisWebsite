                    <h4>Kids</h4>
                    <p>Kids from 7 up can join.  Only very basic reading skills are necessary.  We’ll be splitting up the kids depending on their abilities.  Once you’ve mastered one skillset, we’ll move onto a tougher one so that you’re always challenged and having fun.  We don’t want anyone to be bored!</p>

                    <p>Due to large numbers this year, we are making a waiting list for the next intake of new kids. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kh7WkqYj6SIjOg4rRgzx9Q-4GTi4Or8ed6dRCUaACzM/viewform?usp=send_form">fill out this form</a> to be put on the waiting list. When you’ve received an email invitation with the start date, you will be asked to fill in a registration form and you’ll be added to the member database.</p>

                    <h4>Volunteers</h4>

                    <p>Got a skill you think the kids would like to learn?  We could certainly use some help.  Email us at enniscoderdojo@gmail.com and let us know you’d like to become a mentor.  We’re all volunteers though, so the only payment is a great feeling of accomplishment.</p>

                    <p>We can also use non-technical volunteers as well for the administrative tasks and supervision.  Email us at enniscoderdojo@gmail.com and let us know that you’d like to get involved.</p>

                    <p>If you're interrested in volunteering at our club, please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoderDojoEnnis?ref=ts&fref=ts">send us a message on our Facebook account</a>.</p>
