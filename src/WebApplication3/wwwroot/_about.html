                        <p>Coder = computer programmer.<br />Dojo = gathering place for learning.</p>
                        <p>CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. Dojos organise tours of technology companies, bring in guest speakers to talk about their career and what they do, and organise events. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.</p>

                        <h3>What Happens at Ennis Coder Dojo?</h3>
                        <p>
                            CoderDojo Ennis runs each Saturday during term-time from 10am - 12pm at St. Flannan’s IT Centre. It is FREE to attend. Computers are available to use on site if kids don’t have access to a laptop. Parents are encouraged to learn with their children. Parents of children aged 12 and under must stay with them at the Dojo. So what exactly happens at a Dojo?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since our dojo started in March, 2012, we’ve tried and tested a few techniques at our club. We’ve found that dividing the kids into teams works very well. It doesn’t matter if they are working on the same project, but they are encouraged to help each other. Everyone has talents in different areas and we’ve found that some teams thrive with each person giving input on ideas, design, artwork, and programming. This also has built new friendships and peer-to-peer mentoring occurs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We obviously don’t expect kids to come in and be computer whizzes but it is helpful if they can read, know the basics of computers (right-click, double clicking, find their way around on a keyboard, etc.), and have a keen desire to learn.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When new ones come to Dojo, they are introduced to Scratch, which gives them a great start at making their own animations and games. We have worksheets to get them started in the basics and then the rest is left up to them. The mentors occasionally give brief demonstrations on a variety of subjects. The topic is usually decided on by what the kids want to learn or are having difficulty with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We also have an advanced room. This room is much more diverse and varies with the kids’ interests and mentors available. We have had kids work in Unity, Java, JavaScript, C#, HTML, Arduino, Robocode, App inventor, GIMP, Blender, GitHub to name a few.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Around 11.30, we gather both rooms together and get the kids prepared for “Show and Tell”. Anyone that wants to show their project is welcomed to the front and they get to present it on the overhead projector. It has become the highlight of the day and is eagerly anticipated by both the kids and adults.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we hear of competitions, we share these with the kids and spur them on to participate. We’ve had 2 National Scratch Competition winners in 2013 and 2014. We post competitions, news from other dojos, and other related articles regularly on Facebook and Twitter.
