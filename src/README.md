# CoderDojo Ennis Public Website

This is a mostly static html website (public folder), wrapped in a NUXT 4 application for future expansion.

Feel free to edit the content and make a pull request. Or even better, convert from nasty old static html to modern vue/nuxt code using the pages folder.

## Developing Locally

Setup with
`yarn install`

Run with
`yarn dev`

Committing to github will deploy the website.
